      <h1>File Paths</h1>
      <p>File paths define the location of files. These files include images and documents. There are two types of file paths: absolute paths and relative file paths. Absolute paths specify the full location of the file and relative file paths are based on the location of the HTML file. Relative paths are usually used for their flexibility.</p>
      <h2>Absolute File Paths</h2>
      <p>Absolute file paths should be used when a file from within the file system needs to be accessed without relying on the current directory.</p>
      <h2>Relative File Paths</h2>
      <p>Relative file paths should be used for looking for files within a project.</p>
